Integration of LLMs with vector embeddings and storage allows processing large documents for pertinent information. Vector embeddings convert document contents for LLM comprehension. Splitting techniques like RecursiveSplitting, Token splitting, and context-aware splitting optimize document handling. Retrieval of similar vectors from the database aids in answering questions. Techniques such as MapReduce assist in managing lengthy documents efficiently.


Evaluating LangChain performance typically involves verifying its results against original dataset details, which can be arduous with numerous documents. QAGenerateChain automates question-answer pair creation for each document. Then, using QAEvalChain along with LLM, responses are evaluated against documents, streamlining the assessment process without manual enumeration, leveraging the model's capabilities for evaluation.
